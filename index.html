  <div class="fist-vivision">
    <div class="yess">
<p>We are honored and humbled to hear of all the fantastic work our students do on behalf of Operation Smile. From selling facemasks with a smile to rallying essential supplies, and a host of other creative ways to being our patients’ needs to a wider audience, our students are proactive, creative, and impactful – and we are so lucky to have you all as part of our global family.</p>
    <p> In recognition of our most dedicated students’ devotion to our cause, and to further empower you, we welcome you to apply to take the next step in your journey with Operation Smile: attending surgical programs.</p>

<h2>THE THREE PRIMARY ROLES OF THE STUDENT TEAM ON SURGICAL PROGRAMS</h2>
<div  class="last-one">
  <ul>
<li>Relationship building: The student team plays a major role in comforting the patients throughout the program and connecting with them on a deeper level. In addition, the team collaborates with local student clubs and volunteers to share ideas, knowledge and experiences, offering support and strategizing over future endeavors.
</li>
  <li>Program Support: Every program is different, and the needs of the team will change depending on the site. Staff – such as volunteer coordinators, medical records, post-operative nurses, and the kitchen team – will all need help with small, but key, tasks throughout the course of the program. We expect our student team to be proactive and seek out these opportunities and ensure the smooth running of the surgical program.</li>
  <li>Education: The student team teaches children and adults at the hospital. Students may also go on off-site visits to orphanages, schools, and more in the surrounding community. Our student volunteers educate young patients and community members about:
    <ul>
      <li>Basic health care</li>
      <li>Burn care and prevention</li>
      <li>Dental hygiene</li>
      <li>Hands-only CPR</li>
      <li>Nutrition</li>
      <li>Empathy</li>
      <li>Post-lip care</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
